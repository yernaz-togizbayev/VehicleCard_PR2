# 🃏 Vehicle Card Game – Java OOP Project

This project is a **Java-based card collection game** where players can own and interact with **vehicle cards**.  
It demonstrates **object-oriented programming (OOP)** with inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

- Each **vehicle** is represented as a **card** with attributes  
- Players can hold cards, compare them, and use special editions  
- Includes a **foil card variant** that extends the base functionality  
- Implemented fully in Java with a simple text-based interface

## ✨ Features

- 🎴 **VehicleCard**: Base class for all vehicle cards  
- ✨ **FoilVehicleCard**: Special edition with unique attributes  
- 🧑 **Player**: Holds a collection of cards  
- ▶️ **Main**: Demonstrates the program with example runs
